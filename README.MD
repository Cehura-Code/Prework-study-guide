## Description


- The motivation behind creating this webpage is ultimately to understand how to create a webpage using full-stack.
- I created this webpage to enhance my coding capabilities and to understand the 'how' behind creating a webpage.
- This enables a user friendly-site while helping developers and/or aspiring developers alike with helpful resources and information that I have learned along the way.
- I learned how to implement HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in order to create a fully functioning webpage amongst the full stacking development behind it.
